# KSP-CFG mode

A major-mode for editing Kerbal Space Program part (and other things) config files in Emacs.

## Status

* Release 0.1; should work with packagers
* Syntactic lex with good (well, enthusiastic and correct if not tasteful) highlighting
* Intelligent automatic indentation
* Context-sensitive advice in the minibuffer

## To-Do features

* Support more [ModuleManager](https://github.com/sarbian/ModuleManager) syntaxes; variables, regexps, and node-indexing aren't implemented.
* Refactor context help
* Better context help for common node-keys and modules

## Features probably needed for a wider release

* More conservative cleanup-on-load settings
* Testing by more people
